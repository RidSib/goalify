# Goalify - Achieve Your Personal Goals
Goalify is a tool that transforms self-development books into personalized, gamified action plans to help users achieve their goals. By selecting a book and defining a specific objective, users receive a structured roadmap, divided into a timeline, each step incorporating key principles from the book.

An AI-powered chatbot provides guidance, motivation, and dynamic adjustments, ensuring steady progress. The system follows an interactive, level-based approach, where completing tasks unlocks new challenges. With Goalify, reading becomes actionableâ€”turning insights into real-world success. ðŸš€ðŸ“š
